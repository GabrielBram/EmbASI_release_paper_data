 Intermediate Information:
 WARNING: These are not faithful, ground-state KS total energies - 
 In the case of low-level references, they are calculated using the 
 density components of the high-level energy reference for fragment A. 
 Do not naively use these energies unless you are comfortable with 
 their true definition. 
 Total Energy (A+B Low-Level): -14854.890987414316 eV
 Total Energy (A Low-Level): -6190.372987019375 eV
 Total Energy (A High-Level): -6190.372987019404 eV
 Projection operator energy correction DM^(A_HL) @ Pb: -5.3246368626747034e-14 eV
 First order energy correction (DM^(A_HL)-DM^(A_LL)) @ v_emb): 1.9737511456594025e-12 eV
  
 Final Energies Information:
 Final total energy (Uncorrected): -14854.890987414343 eV
