 Intermediate Information:
 WARNING: These are not faithful, ground-state KS total energies - 
 In the case of low-level references, they are calculated using the 
 density components of the high-level energy reference for fragment A. 
 Do not naively use these energies unless you are comfortable with 
 their true definition. 
 Total Energy (A+B Low-Level): -14854.952608808366 eV
 Total Energy (A Low-Level): -4068.5421870868513 eV
 Total Energy (A High-Level): -4068.542187086918 eV
 Projection operator energy correction DM^(A_HL) @ Pb: -2.94554379637324e-13 eV
 First order energy correction (DM^(A_HL)-DM^(A_LL)) @ v_emb): -3.5308501653094254e-12 eV
  
 Final Energies Information:
 Final total energy (Uncorrected): -14854.952608808437 eV
 Final total energy (Projection Corrected): -14854.952608808437 eV
