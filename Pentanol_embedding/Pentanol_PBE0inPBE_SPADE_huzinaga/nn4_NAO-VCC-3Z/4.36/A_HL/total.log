  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual
  and density convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho below which sc_init_iter
  takes no effect.
 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.195959E-04 .

  | Using a version of the partition function of Stratmann and coworkers ('stratmann_sparse').
  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to
  | only those atoms whose free-atom density would be non-zero at that grid point.
  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.
  | Adjusted default value of keyword multip_moments_threshold to:       0.10000000E-11

  Coulomb operator: Defaulting to logarithmic spherical Bessel transform integrals (use_logsbt .true.).
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  LVL not implemented with density matrix yet
  -> switching to transformed overlap
  LVL probably works better with logsbt
  Default to 1D ("use_logsbt") integrations for auxiliary 2-center integrals.
  Default onset of logarithmic r-grid for SBT is -38.000000000000
  Default onset of logarithmic k-grid for SBT is -25.000000000000
  Default range of logarithmic r- and k-grid for SBT is  45.000000000000

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.74759364 eV

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.74800575 eV

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -13268.854984860 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -13268.854984860 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual
  and density convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho below which sc_init_iter
  takes no effect.
 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.195959E-04 .

  | Using a version of the partition function of Stratmann and coworkers ('stratmann_sparse').
  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to
  | only those atoms whose free-atom density would be non-zero at that grid point.
  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.
  | Adjusted default value of keyword multip_moments_threshold to:       0.10000000E-11
  | This value may affect high angular momentum components of the Hartree potential in periodic systems.
  Spin handling was not defined in control.in. Defaulting to unpolarized case.
  Threshold for auxiliary basis singularities not set.
  Default threshold for auxiliary basis singularities:  0.1000E-04
  No q(lm)/r^(l+1) cutoff set for long-range Hartree potential.
  | Using default value of  0.100000E-09 .
  | Verify using the multipole_threshold keyword.
  Defaulting to new monopole extrapolation.
  Density update method: density matrix based density update selected.
  Scalapack and density-matrix based density update required:
  Switching to packed matrix format "index" by default.
  Coulomb operator: Defaulting to screening threshold for four-center integrals:   0.100000E-06
  Coulomb operator: Defaulting to screening threshold for Coulomb matrix:   0.100000E-09
  Fock matrix calculation: Setting the screening threshold for overlap matrix to coul_mat_threshold:   0.100000E-09
  Coulomb operator: Defaulting to logarithmic spherical Bessel transform integrals (use_logsbt .true.).
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  LVL not implemented with density matrix yet
  -> switching to transformed overlap
  LVL probably works better with logsbt
  Default to 1D ("use_logsbt") integrations for auxiliary 2-center integrals.
  Default onset of logarithmic r-grid for SBT is -38.000000000000
  Default onset of logarithmic k-grid for SBT is -25.000000000000
  Default range of logarithmic r- and k-grid for SBT is  45.000000000000
  Default number of logarithmic r- and k-grid for SBT is   4096
  Found no potential conflicts with setting 'use_local_index' for this calculation.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.74759364 eV

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.74800575 eV

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -13268.854984859 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -13268.854984859 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
