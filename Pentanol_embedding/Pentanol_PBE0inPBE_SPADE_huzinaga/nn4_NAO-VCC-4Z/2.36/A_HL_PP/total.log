  XC: Using hybrid-PBE0 functionals.
  Scalar relativistic treatment of kinetic energy: on-site free-atom approximation to ZORA.
  Occupation type: Gaussian broadening, width =   0.100000E-01 eV.
  Using pulay charge density mixing.
  Kohn-Sham electronic structure solved by the ELSI library.
  The 'LVL' version of RI (resolution of identity) technique is used.
  ** This is a localized expansion of all basis function products.
     Its intended use are Hartree-Fock and hybrid functionals.
     For RPA, MP2, GW, etc., LVL is not yet as accurate. In those cases, check carefully.
  Pulay mixing - number of memorized iterations:   10
  MO localisation with PM objective function calculated with Mulliken charges
  Atomic Solver XC: Using user-defined functional for generating the minimal NAO basis functions.
  Note that only the following functionals are available: kli, pz-lda, pw-lda, vwn, vwn-gauss, pw91_gga, pbe, rpbe, revpbe, pbeint, blyp.
  Threshold for basis singularities:  0.1000E-04
  override_illconditioning: Explicitly overriding any built-in checks for an ill-conditioned overlap matrix.

  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual

 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.195959E-04 .

  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):     5.46168700 eV

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -12698.343943102 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -12698.343943102 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  The high-level electronic structure method used in your calculation
  employed our efficient localized resolution of identity for the Coulomb operator.
  Some calculations, especially large-scale hybrid density functional theory,
  are only possible thanks to this development. For this feature, please cite:

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the

  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

  ** This is a localized expansion of all basis function products.

 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :         -12698.343943102 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :         -12698.343943102 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
