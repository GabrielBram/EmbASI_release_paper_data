 Intermediate Information:
 WARNING: These are not faithful, ground-state KS total energies - 
 In the case of low-level references, they are calculated using the 
 density components of the high-level energy reference for fragment A. 
 Do not naively use these energies unless you are comfortable with 
 their true definition. 
 Total Energy (A+B Low-Level): -14855.065670153454 eV
 Total Energy (A Low-Level): -6189.741079361242 eV
 Total Energy (A High-Level): -6191.190701184097 eV
 Projection operator energy correction DM^(A_HL) @ Pb: 0.15735693202019163 eV
 First order energy correction (DM^(A_HL)-DM^(A_LL)) @ v_emb): 1.1460485086094587 eV
  
 Final Energies Information:
 Final total energy (Uncorrected): -14855.3692434677 eV
 Final total energy (Projection Corrected): -14855.211886535679 eV
