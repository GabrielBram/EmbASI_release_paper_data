          and our main development and support site at

            https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de .

          The latter site, in particular, has a wiki to collect information, as well
          as an issue tracker to log discussions, suggest improvements, and report issues
          or bugs. https://aims-git.rz-berlin.mpg.de is also the main development site
          of the project and all new and updated code versions can be obtained there.
          Please send an email to aims-coordinators@fhi-berlin.mpg.de and we will add
          you to these sites. They are for you and everyone is welcome there.

  Kohn-Sham electronic structure solved by the ELSI library.
  The 'LVL' version of RI (resolution of identity) technique is used.
  ** This is a localized expansion of all basis function products.
     Its intended use are Hartree-Fock and hybrid functionals.

  MO localisation with PM objective function calculated with Mulliken charges
  Atomic Solver XC: Using user-defined functional for generating the minimal NAO basis functions.

 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.78520687 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -4463.099181343 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -4463.099181343 eV
  | Total energy after the post-s.c.f. correlation calculation     :          -4473.157857638 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Total energy of the post-s.c.f. correlation calculation        :
  | Resolution of identity used for the 2-electron Coulomb operator:          RI_LVL_fast
  | The actual meaning of this energy depends on the setting for the 'total_energy_method'
  | keyword (MP2, RPA, rPT2, etc). If not sure, compare to the results listed above.

          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:      108.622 MB (on task 238 after allocating dm_dump_sparse)
          |   Maximum:      108.817 MB (on task   7 after allocating dm_dump_sparse)
          |   Average:      108.721 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       32.437 MB (rotation_matrix_cmplx on task   0)
          |   Maximum:       32.437 MB (rotation_matrix_cmplx on task   0)
          |   Average:       32.437 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
